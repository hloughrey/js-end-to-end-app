# Web Service
This is a web service application which will serve out data depending on the URL being called.
Ideally this would be hooked up to a database...but time didn't permit, in the meantime you can copy the `cruise_data.json` file generated from the `dummy_data_generator` into `lib`

This app runs on `localhost:3000`

## Getting Started
* npm install
* npm run start
* try the two URLs
  * `http://localhost:3000`
  * `http://localhost:3000/cruises`
