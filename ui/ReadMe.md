# UI
This is a very basis UI which take the results of the `http://localhost:3000/cruises` & presents them in a table. It is built using React.js so is pretty quick. Had time allowed you could hook this up to React-Router, Redux etc to create something more impressive.

# Getting Started
* npm install
* npm run build
* npm run dev
* Open a browser & go to http://localhost:8080
