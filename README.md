# JS End-toEnd App
This is a little web app with a front-end built with React which takes the results of a AJAX call to a backend webservice built on Express and presents them as a table.
The idea of this app is to better understand how to implement end-to-end testing.

# Getting Started
* Follow the ReadMe instructions within each application;
* The webservice should be running on Port 3000
* The ui should be running on port 8080

**The application will only present results if both applications are running**
